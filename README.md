## Abstract
**Hardware Web Binding** is a proposed standard to allow developers to bind hardware interactions (Sensors, LEDs, Serial devices) directly to HTML elements using declarative attributes. This reduces the complexity of writing imperative JavaScript for common IoT tasks, making the "Physical Web" accessible to educators, students, and rapid-prototyping engineers.
